# Customer Segmentation in the US using KMeans

In today's business landscape, understanding our customers and tailoring our strategies to their unique preferences is essential for success.
Our project employs K-means clustering, a cutting-edge machine learning technique, to group customers with similar characteristics, enabling us to:

- **Personalize Marketing**: Target our audience with precision, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.
- **Optimize Products and Services**: Tailor offerings to meet specific customer demands, boosting satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Enhance Customer Experience**: Provide better service and improve user experiences by understanding customer preferences.
- **Maximize Profitability**: Allocate resources efficiently by focusing on high-value customer segments.
- **Discover Market Opportunities**: Identify new customer segments for business expansion.

## Notebooks

This project is organized into three notebooks:
1. **Data_exploration.ipynb:**: This notebook focuses on exploring and understanding the dataset. It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.

2. **Clustering_using_two_features.ipynb:**: This notebook focuses on performing KMeans clustering using two features from the dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of the clusters.

3. **Multivariate_Clustering_in_CFS_Analysis.ipynb**: This notebook applies multivariate clustering in the analysis of the Consumer Finances Survey data. It includes advanced techniques for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). The SCF is a triennial survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Board that collects information about family incomes, net worth, credit use, and other financial outcomes. A new dataset is released every three years. You can access the dataset from the [Federal Reserve Board's website](^https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm^).
